# DeepDive AI: Research Paper Insights

## Project Description
This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** that allows users to upload AI research papers in PDF format and ask questions about them. It retrieves relevant sections using **semantic search** and generates context-aware answers using **Hugging Face's Flan-T5 model**.

## Features
- **Paper Upload**: Users can upload AI research papers in PDF format.
- **Query-Based Retrieval**: Implements **FAISS-based semantic search** to fetch relevant sections of the paper.
- **Interactive Q&A**: Provides AI-generated answers to user queries based on paper content.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Uses **FAISS and Sentence Transformers** for efficient retrieval.

## Tech Stack
### **Backend**
- **Text Extraction**: PyMuPDF (fitz) for extracting structured text from PDFs.
- **Vectorization**: Sentence Transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
- **Vector Database**: FAISS for fast retrieval.
- **LLM Integration**: Hugging Face model (`flan-t5-large`).

### **Frontend**
- **Framework**: Gradio for an interactive web interface.
- **Deployment**: Hugging Face Spaces for easy cloud hosting.

## Installation & Setup
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/your-username/pdf-rag-bot.git
 cd pdf-rag-bot
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
```sh
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Run the Application**
```sh
 python app.py
```

The biggest advantage of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is that it reduces hallucination by retrieving real-world, factual data from external sources before generating an answer. This makes it more reliable compared to purely generative models like GPT or FLAN-T5, which can sometimes produce hypothetical or incorrect responses.

since RAG combines retrieval (fetching the most relevant information) and generation (creating responses based on that information), it can:

Personalize Learning 🎯

Adaptive tutoring systems can fetch relevant study materials based on a student’s progress.
AI-generated explanations help learners understand difficult topics in a way that suits them best.
Enhance Educator Productivity 👩‍🏫

Teachers can use AI to generate quizzes, summarize lesson plans, and answer student queries with verified sources.
RAG ensures responses are grounded in real knowledge, avoiding hallucinated (hypothetical) answers.
Engage Students with Interactive AI 📚

Chatbots or virtual mentors can retrieve relevant concepts from textbooks and research papers in real-time.
Instead of just answering based on pre-trained data, AI pulls knowledge dynamically from a curated database (like a vector store).


1. **Extract Text**: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Cleans and chunks text for better retrieval.
3. **Embedding Creation**: Converts text into vector embeddings and stores them in FAISS.
4. **Query Processing**: Accepts user queries, retrieves relevant chunks, and generates AI-based answers.
5. **Frontend Interaction**: Users upload PDFs, input queries, and get AI-generated responses in real-time.

## Deployment Guide (Hugging Face Spaces)
### **1. Upload to Hugging Face**
- Create a new **Hugging Face Space**.
- Select **Gradio** as the framework.
- Upload your project files (`app.py`, `requirements.txt`).

### **2. Define Dependencies**
Ensure `requirements.txt` includes:
```sh
faiss-cpu
sentence-transformers
transformers
gradio
p
PyMuPDF
```

### **3. Launch the App**
Once uploaded, the app will automatically deploy in Hugging Face Spaces.

## Example Use Case
### **Input:**
"What is the main contribution of the paper?"

### **Process:**
- Retrieves relevant sections from the abstract and conclusion.
- Uses **FLAN-T5** to generate a response based on retrieved context.

### **Output:**
"The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a novel transformer-based architecture that improves model efficiency by 25% while maintaining state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets."
